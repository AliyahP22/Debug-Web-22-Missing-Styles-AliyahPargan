    <p>Welcome to the author page for Terry R.! Terry is the author of a series of books about music. She was born in Copenhagen, Denmark and began learning to play instruments from a young age. Terry wanted to share her love for music with others, and it inspired her to write books to teach others about how they can use music in their lives.</p>
<!--In order to fix the bug, you need to go to the style.css file and add the { next to the p. Then, your code should work. If it still doesnt work, you can rewrite the line and it should work.-->
